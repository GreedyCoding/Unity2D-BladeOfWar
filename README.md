Blade of War is a 2D "Shoot-'em-up" game, crafted as a personal hobby project and a tribute to the beloved classic, Warblade from 2003.


Features of Blade of War:

Simplistic yet Challenging Gameplay: Designed to be easy to pick up but still provide a rather challenging experience.
Nostalgic Visuals: The game features a retro aesthetic, mixed with my personal touch, while trying to stay in line with a game made in a different era.


This game is a humble nod to the games of the 2000s, a project born out of curiosity and love for game development. This project was my playground for getting to grips with game development, and a project that i could finish in a reasonable timeframe, all the while paying homage to a game that got me interested in gaming in my early years.

For me it´s not just a game but a diary of my learning process. While it may not have the polish of a fully-fledged title, it's a piece of my passion for games and a testament to the joy of making something of your own. I hope you can also have some fun while playing this game.

Join me in this adventure through the stars. Blade of War is more than just a shoot-'em-up: it's a journey, an experiment, and most importantly it´s also fun!
